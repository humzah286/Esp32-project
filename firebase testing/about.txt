this small project is to test our connection to firebase database

we send different types of data types in our test node of JSON file that is stored in Firebase. 

In return, Our micro-controller fetches those results and displays them on our serial monitor, as shown in image "after 2 iterations" 

exported JSON object is also attached in this folder.
