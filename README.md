# Esp32-project

As this course was our first hardware course in which we practically worked with micro-controllers, hence, it was difficult to start right away with the project. 

I have made a practise file in which i gradually tried and improved my skills on programming for ESP-32. At first, few projects were made on platform IO, but as my project was on ESP_32 cam module, it was difficult to carry on with Platform IO and i had to switch on Arduino IDE, where i first tested basic sample codes such as camera web server, face detection and recognition and etc.
